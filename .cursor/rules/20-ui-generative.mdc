## Components (whitelist only)
- `Table`
- `Chart` (kinds: `line`, `bar`, `scatter`)
- `Map` (GeoJSON via react-leaflet)

> Unknown component types must be ignored (log a warning).

## Patch protocol (what the backend may emit)
Only these ops are allowed:
```json
{"op":"append","path":"/children","value":<Component>}
{"op":"set","path":"/children/<index>","value":<Component>}
